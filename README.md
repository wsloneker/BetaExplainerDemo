# BetaExplainerDemo
BetaExplainer is a probabilistic explainer method for GNNs for paper BetaExplainer: A Probabilistic Method to Explain Graph Neural Networks. It allows for prioritization of important edges based on the probability of an edge. It is capable of performing well against specific graph features by providing priors.
