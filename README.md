# BetaExplainerDemo
## Description
We present BetaExplainer, a new GNN explainer method. This formulation takes advantage of probabalisitic learning to convey uncertainty in edge importance and provide prior information on edge importance. It outperforms GNNExplainer and SubgraphX on the unfaithfulness metric for challenging datasets. Our model is demonstrated below:
